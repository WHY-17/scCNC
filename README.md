# scCNC
A Method based on Capsule Network for Clustering scRNA-seq Data

The scCNC model was implemented in Python 3 using PyTorch version 1.8.1.
You can perform modularity_train.py to run scCNC. The given kolod dataset is preprocessed. If you want to use others, you should preprocess the data first by using preprocessing.py.
